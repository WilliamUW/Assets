🚀 $34,700 CAD in winnings 
🏆 14 hackathon wins 
🌍 9 cities, 3 countries, 2 continents in 3 months.

I went from not knowing game development 🎮 to building hackathon-winning Meta Quest 3 VR experiences using Unity and C# solo in under 8 hours, including most recently winning 2nd Place and $6,800 CAD at Microsoft’s GenAI Hackathon out of 1200+ participants!

I went from being intimidated by Solidity to deploying 50+ Rust, Cairo, and EVM smart contracts across 8 blockchain hackathons, including winning $8,800 CAD at the world's largest blockchain hackathon at ETHDenver ‘24 🌐—and even making headlines in a University of Waterloo article about my journey (which still feels surreal)! 

✈ My travels took me to London, UK for the first time, and to cities like Denver, Miami, Austin, NYC & more—a total of 9 cities across 5 timezones!

I owe so much to hackathons, which is why I am thrilled to announce the launch of Hackathons Canada 🍁 where you can discover upcoming hackathons, form powerhouse teams, and coordinate travel & stay with 1,100+ hackers across Canada!

In a world full of uncertainty, there’s no better feeling than knowing you can transform any idea into reality within a weekend. 🌟

I can’t wait to continue building—Thank you to all the amazing people I had the pleasure of meeting and learning from! 🙌

🙌 Thank you to:
- Waterloo Blockchain for flying me to ETHDenver in 2023 and introducing me to the world of blockchain.
- Benjamin Liang and Andrew Liang for your mentorship on Computer Vision/ML & Smart Contract integrations.

🥇 Super excited to announce that my team won $10,000 CAD (3 First Place Prizes + 4 Sponsor Prizes) at ETHGlobal Waterloo - Canada's largest blockchain hackathon!

We are thrilled to have our Mr. Goose design selected as the Official NFT Collection for ETHGlobal Waterloo 2023 (to be distributed to all 650+ attendees)!

ETHWaterloo NFT Collection: https://lnkd.in/dhM_dr5B

I teamed up with Benjamin Liang and Andrew Liang to build our project Goose.ai with the help of the sponsors Highlight.xyz, Polygon Labs, Filecoin Foundation, Worldcoin, QuickNode ⚡, UMA , The Graph, Gnosis , Nouns, and MetaMask who aided us in integrating with their tech stack!

In anticipation for the Web3 future, my team and I built Goose.ai, a platform-agnostic LLM that lowers the barrier of entry to Web3 services and blockchain data visualization tools across mobile, Discord, Slack, and Telegram Messenger.

Thank you to ETHGlobal for hosting such an incredible event and to all the amazing individuals I got the chance to meet!

🥇 Super excited to announce that my team won First Place Overall (Grand Prize of $5000) at OlympiHacks - Canada's largest chain-agnostic hackathon!

I teamed up with Benjamin Liang and Alysa Zhao to build our project InterPal with the help of the sponsors Solana Labs, Axelar Network, NEAR Protocol, and Jackal Labs who aided us in integrating with their tech stack! 

In anticipation for the inter-chain future, my team and I built InterPal, an AI-driven chatbot that allows anyone to send interchain messages, tokens, and mint NFTs across 13 different chains through chat.

🏆 Super thrilled to announce that my team has won over $4,000 across 9 Sponsor Prizes at ETHGlobal New York!

I teamed up with Benjamin, Alejandro, Anish, and Melany to build out our project Reputable with the help of the 9 sponsors Worldcoin, WalletConnect, The Arbitrum Foundation, 1inch Network, QuickNode ⚡, Mantle Network, The Graph, Neon Labs and UMA who aided us in integrating with their tech stack during the 36 hours of hacking! 

To tackle the problem of over $76 billion in fraudulently used funds in 2022, we built an on-chain reputation system that empowers individuals to evaluate and contribute to the trustworthiness of funds through transparent and immutable transaction disputes overseen by an optimistic oracle.

Thank you to ETHGlobal for hosting such an incredible event and to all the amazing individuals I got the chance to meet in NYC! 😄

September 8, 2023, Martin managed William directlySeptember 8, 2023, Martin managed William directly
I was William’s manager for his Summer 2023 internship in the BDC Capital Operations & Strategy team. William delivered outstanding results, working 20+ hours per week on top of a full-time curriculum at Waterloo University.

William’s diligence, strong work ethic, attention to detail, and positivity made him a valuable asset to our team. He constantly leveraged his Computer Science and Finance knowledge to generate unique insights and problem-solving approaches. I was particularly impressed by William’s curiosity and ability to seize opportunities at work and externally through networking events, conferences, and hackathons. William’s strong network also helped us source our two fantastic new interns without having to post. 

William earns my recommendation as an extraordinary talent that any team would be lucky to have.I was William’s manager for his Summer 2023 internship in the BDC Capital Operations & Strategy team.
